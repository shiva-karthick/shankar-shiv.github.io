		<h1>Double Win at Amazon Web Services Public Sector Summit 2018</h1>

			My team's solution was focused on transcribing doctor’s medical jargon, nurse’s medical instruction/direction, categorizing the data into bite-sized information where patients access through a dynamically generated QR code, and to navigate the respective clinics in KK Women's and Children's Hospital using Augmented Reality.

		<h1>Champion of Bosch Ville Hackathon 2018</h1>
		<p class="desc">
			My team was the champion of the Bosch Ville Hackathon 2018. We implemented an IoT based product with custom machine learning models and cloud computing allowing farmers and researchers to experiment on different nutrient concentrations in order to promote plant growth and increase yield. This would help tackle the issue of world hunger which is a Sustainable Development Goal. Our idea was so impressive that we were given a chance to engage in a partnership with Bosch to bring the product to market.
