Hello! I'm Shankar, an undergraduate UROP student pursuing electrical engineering in National University of Singapore (NUS). My research interests include Artificial Intelligence, cyber-physical systems and everything in between. I have won in many hackathons such as Bosch and Amazon Web Services. I am currently doing research on reinforcement learning. Hit me up on twitter or send me an email if you wish to contact me.
