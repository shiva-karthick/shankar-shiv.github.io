# Who am I?

Hello! I'm Shiva Shankar, an undergraduate student pursuing Electrical Engineering with a specialization in IoT (Internet Of Things, Computer Science) in NUS (National University of Singapore). 

My research interests include Machine Learning (CS3244), IoT systems and Control Theory. I have won in many hackathons organised by Bosch and AWS (Amazon Web Services) with my amazing group of friends. 
I am currently working under the direction of Professor [Charles Lim](https://www.ccwlim.com/), whose area of specialization is quantum computing.

# Motivations

This blog represents how I personally understand the ideas. I prefer to make notes in my iPad when I learn anything online, like from a course. Maintaining the notes and finding them quickly has become a hassle after taking many courses and reading from various websites. It gradually becomes tiresome to have to go back and forth through my notes every time I wanted to learn about an algorithm that I had previously studied.

As a consequence, I started this personal blog. There are two primary reasons for this. I enjoy educating and simplifying ideas. Since I desire to write, this is the ideal combination of the two. Second, because the code, intuition, and math are all in one place, this serves as a personal logbook that I can use whenever I need to. To ensure that everything actually works, I also try to demonstrate the principles in code along with the outcomes.
