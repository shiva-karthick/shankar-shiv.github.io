Hello! I'm Shiva Shankar, an undergraduate student pursuing Electrical Engineering with a specialization in IoT (Internet Of Things, Computer Science) in NUS (National University of Singapore). 

My research interests include Machine Learning (CS3244), IoT systems and Control Theory. I have won in many hackathons organised by Bosch and AWS (Amazon Web Services) with my amazing group of friends. 
I am currently working under the direction of Professor [Charles Lim](https://www.ccwlim.com/), whose area of specialization is quantum computing.
