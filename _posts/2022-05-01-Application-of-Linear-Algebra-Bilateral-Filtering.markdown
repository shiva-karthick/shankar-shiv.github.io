When I was a first-year undergraduate at the National University of Singapore, I enrolled in [MA1508E](https://nusmods.com/modules/MA1508E/linear-algebra-for-engineering) Linear Algebra class. I had a vague understanding of linear algebra before enrolling, even after taking three Additional Mathematics modules at Singapore Polytechnic. I was quite enthralled by the linear algebra concepts at the completion of the course.
