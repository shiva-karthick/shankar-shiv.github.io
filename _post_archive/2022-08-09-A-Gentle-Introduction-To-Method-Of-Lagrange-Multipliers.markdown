### Lagrange multiplier
Let’s focus on finding a solution for a general optimization problem. Consider the cost function f=x+y with the equality constraint h: x² + y² = 25, the red circle below.


This tutorial is divided into 2 parts; they are:

- Method of Lagrange multipliers with equality constraints
- Two solved examples
